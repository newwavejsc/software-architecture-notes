# Software Architecture Notes

This repository contains general notes and references related to software architecture and system design.

The content focuses on high-level architectural principles and patterns commonly used in modern web and distributed systems.

---

## Overview

Software architecture defines how different components of a system are structured and how they interact with each other.

Good architecture balances scalability, maintainability, performance, and development efficiency, while adapting to real-world constraints.

---

## Architectural Principles

Some commonly applied architectural principles include:

- Separation of concerns
- Modularity and loose coupling
- Scalability and fault tolerance
- Simplicity and clarity over complexity

These principles guide long-term system evolution.

---

## Common Architecture Patterns

Modern software systems often adopt patterns such as:

- Monolithic architecture
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven systems
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

Each pattern has trade-offs depending on project context.

---

## Scalability and Reliability

Scalable systems are designed to handle growth gracefully.

Key considerations include:
- Stateless services
- Horizontal scaling
- Redundancy and failover strategies
- Monitoring and observability

Reliability is a continuous concern, not a one-time decision.
