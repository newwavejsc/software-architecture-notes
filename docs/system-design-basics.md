# System Design Basics

This document provides basic considerations for system design in software projects.

## Understanding Requirements

System design starts with understanding:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Business constraints

Without clear requirements, architectural decisions are often misaligned.

## Trade-offs in Design

Every architectural decision involves trade-offs.

Common trade-offs include:
- Performance vs complexity
- Speed vs maintainability
- Scalability vs cost

Making these trade-offs explicit helps teams make better decisions.

## Evolution Over Time

Systems rarely remain static.

Good architecture allows:
- Incremental improvements
- Component replacement
- Adaptation to changing needs

Designing for change is often more valuable than optimizing for perfection.
